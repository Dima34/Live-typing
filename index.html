                    <h2>How to Improve Your Typing <br> Speed</h2>
                    <p>Today, almost all over the world, the age of computers and technology prevails. Therefore, in our digital world, touch typing has become a necessity. Many people including employees, businessmen, students, teachers, scientists, are all using computers on a daily basis. Everything has started to revolve around computers, even communication. This is why touch typing becomes imperative for everybody – it allows you to type faster, easier, and without any efforts</p>

                    <h2>What Is the Best 10-Finger <br>
                        Typing Layout?</h2>
                    <p>Of course, you should use ten fingers for typing, but you can start with a layout that’s the most comfortable for you. The small bumps on the F and J keys will help your fingers locate the correct position without looking. This setup should give you a full range of motion. The more you type, the faster you will get. There are a few alternative layouts that propose a more ergonomic approach to typing. You could also take the big leap and try out the Dvorak keyboard, but that’s a different story.</p>

                    <h2>Who Invented the Qwerty  <br>
                        Keyboard?</h2>
                    <p>The QWERTY keyboard was invented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. He also designed the first successful typewriter. The order of the keys was decided by listing the most common letter combinations and making sure that they were not placed next to each other. He did this to avoid problems that often happened when two neighboring keys were pressed consecutively. The QWERTY keyboard is used to this day and is the most widely used keyboard available.</p>

                        Test</h2>
                    <p>We’ve decided to use the 1,000 most common words in the English language. Additionally, we wanted to include words that you can find in our blog articles. You can think of it as a touch of LiveChat’s flavor to make the typing test a bit more interesting. This free typing speed test focuses on typing itself, so words appear randomly. Reading full sentences may influence your typing speed.</p>

                    <p>As the makers of LiveChat, customer service software for businesses, we wanted to provide the community of our customers and live chat agents with a free typing test. This way, they can consistently practice typing and improve their typing skills. We've also made this tool accessible to every visitor of our page. Our tool is a free typing speed test with a WPM score, but it can be also used as a typing speed test for kids.</p>

Our typing speed test will keep track of all typing tests that you’ve taken in the past so you will be able to see the improvements over time. You will be able to see how your speed typing has changed. If you can do a five-minute typing test every day, your typing skills will increase dramatically.</p>

                        to Everyone?</h2>
                    <p>The faster you type, the faster you will be able to communicate with others. You will be able to save a ton of time on any kind of work that requires typing. At first, it will be a couple of extra minutes that you won’t really notice. Over time, the minutes will turn into hours of saved time that you can spend on other activities.</p>

                    <h2>What Is the Average Typing <br>
                        Speed?</h2>
                    <p>The average person types between 38 and 40 words per minute (WPM). That translates into between 190 and 200 characters per minute (CPM). However, professional typists type a lot faster, averaging between 65 and 75 WPM.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <h2>What Is CPM and How Can You <br>
                        Calculate It?</h2>
                    <p>The CPM stands for the number of characters you type per minute, including all the mistakes. “Corrected” scores count only correctly typed words. WPM is just the corrected CPM divided by five. This is the de facto international standard.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>How Many Words per Minute Is a <br>
                        Good Score?</h2>
                    <p>An average professional typist usually types around 65 to 75 WPM. More advanced positions require 80 to 95 (this is typically the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive typing jobs). There are also some advanced typists whose work requires speeds above 120 WPM.</p>
